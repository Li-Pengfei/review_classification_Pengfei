2684,"Actually, 2-3 days before, I have sold my car because; I have upgraded a new model of Fortuner car. I had purchased my car in 2014 and in 2017; my car is completed 3 years. Just 2-3 months, before tire-bush of my car was damaged and my car was under warranty period. When I showed my car to dealership staff of Topsel Gangtok, he informed me that tire-bush of my car is damaged. They said actually it is not damaged; it is a bit worn out and my car is under warranty period, so they will change it immediately then I said ok. After that, the dealership staffs ordered the parts and when the part came, he called me and asked me to visit the dealership but I could not go there due to some busy schedule. After 15-20 days or 1 month, when I was free, I called the dealership staff then he said to me he had given that part to someone else, that means they do not keep the parts inventory. The dealership staff told me, if I will do late after October my car?s warranty period will be over, for the part, which is under warranty period, I have to pay extra charges for it. It is his initiative behavior that for the second time, he ordered the part and clearly told me that, he was ordering the part for the second time and once he will call me I have to visit the dealership within 2 days to change the part. Otherwise, I will be not liable for that part. This is a good step taken by the dealership staff that with respect, he told me that my car was under warranty period; otherwise, I did not know that my car was under warranty period. First time I had not paid attention for the part, so again the dealership staff had to ordered the part second time. After purchasing the car, customers do not know that how long the car has been completed, it is under warranty or not, they are not clear about that. The dealership staff reminded me that after 2-3 months, my car?s warranty period will be over and he told me if for the second time I will not pay attention then I have to pay charges from my pocket. I have seen a well initiative behavior and this is a good experience for me. He had done his duty by arranging the part; it was my fault that I had not used that part in my car. The staff has fulfilled his responsibility. Afterward If I will lodge, complain then the staff can say that he brought the part and called me to visit the dealership but I had not visited the dealership, so he used that part in some other car. It was a good experience for me. I do not know the name and designation of the staff who had informed me about the tire ? bush of my car.

He did the surprise visit or for anything, I do not know, maybe he was there in a surprise visit.

I took my car to the Gargya Nagaon dealership for repairing the back light and the car servicing was done in Gargya Guwahati dealership, it took long time there in Guwahati because they needed 20-25 days to purchase the backlight, after that I took the delivery from Gargya Nagaon dealership.

On that day during my car delivery, I wrote down on the form to try to continue to keep the relation as their behavior was very good but they didnt continue at all. It happens in our country that the situation before car purchase and after car purchase is different. I purchased my car on 20th march, 2014. I have never done any work of my car from outside dealer; even I dont use the other Mobil and every time I buy the full can of synthetic Mobil for my car.  As I drive my car by my own, so I never compromise regarding my car. I also change the tire regularly and fix the Yokohama tire from the Topsel showroom only. Once the Topsel staffs couldnt give me the service booking for my car and I went to Saini Toyota dealership. Otherwise in these 3-3.5 years all the servicing of my car I have done at Topsel Kolkata EM bypass dealership. After 10000 Kms, I do the Mobil change and checking of my cars wheel, alignment balance, battery and everything though, they tell me to do it or not.  During purchasing, my car everyone came to the spot, servicing engineers and the marketing managers, pictures were clicked, explanation about the car was made. Before purchasing this car, I told them that I didnt need any explanation for this car, so they told me that I was the only customer who told them not to explain about the car. I had brought full draft, so told them to take the full payment and I asked them just to confirm the date when they could deliver the car with the registration number before or on 20th march, 2014. They kept their promise, this thing I felt good for. They kept their commitment and did the registration of my car on proper time and I purchased my car on 20th march, 2014. I dont remember the names of the marketing managers and the servicing engineers who were present during the car purchase. During the car purchase they informed me about a manufacturing issue that one of the back light dont lit up as its useless so its off from the manufacturing. That time I told them that the back-gear was different so I wanted to take a small test-drive there and they agreed.

1678,"Last time I went to Jayeshree Toyota in Asansol. I do the servicing in both of Asansol and Banskopa (Durgapur). I went to Asansol for my own work.  But my driver told me that some sound was coming from the backside of the car. So I thought Id get the servicing done in Asansol. So we went to the dealership and there they told me that the rear wheel was flattened, it has to be changed. My driver was new, he drove my car to Kolkata, somewhere there he used the brake and the clip of the bumper was broken. I told the staffs to repair the bumper. Then they told me if they would repair the bumper, Id not get the insurance claim so itd be good if Id do the insurance claim. Then the service manager, Sanjit Chakraborty, he is very good boy, he told me hed receive my car. Last time when I went there for servicing with my Toyota Innova, I talked with Sanjit about my cars bumper. He told me if he repaired the clip and bumper, may be the bumper would not last long as it is broken and also Id not get the insurance claim because he had to screw it to make it tight. He had explained me what I didnt know. He told me that hed give me the form and the front tires had to be changed as there was some problem with the tires of my car. Then I told him to have his meal and asked him about good tires because I was going to Raja tires. He told me about Gusto, Michel and Yokohama because these three tires are approved by Toyota. Then I asked about the rates. He told me a tire would cost 6600 and in total itd cost 6900 including tax and also told me that there was no drama for bills, Id have to pay by cash. Then I got two tires at 12000 rupees and they did the settings and balancing. It is cheap as there is a dealership. I came back with tires and asked him if he had taken his meal. He said that he did it and all the papers are also ready. He told me to go with him; hed drop me at my home. This car is authorized in my fathers name and the insurance is registered also in his name in finance company. So my father has to sign on the insurance claim paper. So at that time we called him and came to know that he was at home. So I came back home with Sanjit and gave him the papers with my fathers signature. This way I didnt have to waste a whole day. He did the log book and sent the photos of my car. He took my car from Asansol and after the work is done, he came back to Asansol with my car. Then I sent my representative there to take back my car. That thing I liked very much that I didnt have to waste a whole day and I got my car back on time when I needed. Because we use that car for long journey and after 2 days my father was to go out with that car. With a small car hed have problems.  We have an Amaze, a Swift Dzire and an Alto. On small roads small car is okay but for long tour you need a big car. It was a very good thing there. What Mr. Sanjit did to me is very good. Hes a very good boy. I told him to do the car body wash here then Id not have to go to Banskopa. He said that its a satellite, and that is the main showroom. So the small things are done here and the car body wash is authorized in that showroom. Then I said, Okay, I will keep my car here and you will take it there and later on you will drop my car at my home. His surname I cant remember. It is beyond of my expectation because if hed have not explained me about that insurance then it would happen like this. What I knew, in that case, Id have taken my car to the showroom and kept it there and came back home by bus. I'd have signed the insurance claim paper from my father and sent the papers to Asansol. Then the car would have been taken from Asansol, itd take one day. Next, a staff of the insurance company would have come to my house for a survey and one more day would have been wasted. The bumper could be changed after the survey, in total itd have taken 3 days. But it took 2 days in my case. I told them that Id need the car after 3 days and I was afraid if they could give back my car or not. But it was good. He made it one day before and told me to take the car back from the dealership.","[(issue resolution, 53.06), (personal need, 23.86), (quick service, 7.45), (detailed explanation, 4.45), (pick up / drop, 3.03), (care from staff, 2.21), (roadside assistance, 1.93), (forgotten stuff, 1.18), (free service / discount, 1.1), (others, 1.03), (gift / free stuff, 0.25), (snacks, 0.25), (dealer event, 0.2)]",issue resolution,6,issue resolution,6

3364,"I was not introduced with the Poddar Toyota dealership before that when I purchased the car, I was introduced with a dealership staff. Her name was Mitali. Some days ago, the AC of my car was disturbing the car for servicing, after contacting to the dealership. They repaired my car AC immediately. I have purchased the car nearly about 5 months ago. My car?s first servicing was after one month of purchasing that time dealership serviced my car very nicely. When my car AC problem was occurred then at first I had contacted with Ms Mitali, I think she is field officer most probably but I am not sure. This AC problem aroused after near about two month of purchasing. I did not expect about the problem, so earlier of purchasing. New car?s AC problem was not a major problem, after starting the car some sound was coming out from the AC and then sound was so loud that I could not refuse. The sound was much unexpected and the noise was very excess. After near about two month this type of problem should not be happened. I thought that time that why was this problem occurred in my new car. Anyways the dealership staffs did the recovery of my cars AC. Ultimately I am satisfied because when the problem occurred, I was in the tension that it would be recovered or not and I also thought that I have to replace full the AC. Ultimately the dealership staff repaired the ac and I didn?t need to replace it. Of course, I shall share my heart touching experience with other persons because I got a good response and repeatedly response from the dealership staffs that is why I will share this experience with other persons and I am satisfied with it. I will rate 5 out of out for this question, I don?t have any problem. Actually always Miss Mitali helps me. At any time, I contacted with her for any issue of my car and she fully cooperated with me. Any work of my car like registration, RC and insurance is done because of Mitali. She always fully cooperated with me. Afterwards I met many of the dealership staffs then I came to know that other staffs are also there in mechanical and technical side. After that, I did not have any contact with Miss Mitali. With whom I met in the dealership, all of them are like friend.  Another day, when I went to the dealership, I met Miss Mitali, she told me, sir you had complained for Ac problem but you didn?t came with your car then I told her no, I came with my car and the dealership staffs had helped me and did the recovery of my car?s ac. Repairing of car Ac is not under Miss Mitali?s department but even then also she asked me about my car Ac problem that is why I am satisfied again and again. I think Miss Mitali had done the booking of my car and informed the dealership staffs that about my car?s Ac problem and told them to help me in my problem. Mitali did not know that next I had visited the dealership and repaired my car?s Ac. , sir you had complained for Ac problem but you didn?t came with your car then I told her no, I came with my car and solved the Ac problem, May be you are not informed about it.

I like the service of Nippon Toyota that they are providing a good service to its customers. I was on the way to Thrissur after going to Annamalai dealership and when I went there in Nippon they took less charge as well as they had returned my vehicle within 2 hours. That was really good experience for me. This is the exact reason that getting my car been serviced in Kerala Nippon Toyota but I purchased my car in Tamil Nadu. In Annamalai they always make me wait a lot and asking Rs. 55000 /- for service and in Nippon Dealership they took around Rs. 40000/- and as well as they gave good service they all are like my friends.,"[(personal need, 65.72), (quick service, 24.01), (issue resolution, 4.38), (pick up / drop, 2.14), (roadside assistance, 1.23), (care from staff, 0.97), (free service / discount, 0.51), (others, 0.41), (forgotten stuff, 0.22), (detailed explanation, 0.15), (dealer event, 0.11), (snacks, 0.08), (gift / free stuff, 0.07)]",personal need,8,issue resolution,6

382,"Now we are staying at Raipur, recently I faced an incident. The distance between Raipur and Rourkela is 430 km. Recently I faced a problem, the Ac of my car was not working. I brought groceries in my car and left rice sack in my car. A rat got in to the car and cut the wire of the AC so AC was not working. I called the dealership of Rourkela from Raipur and I was to get back my home so the dealership staffs told me to take my car to them for servicing. I talked with Mr. Zahir. So I didnt get it fixed in Raipur and I went to Rourkela dealership and fixed it. Whenever I face any technical issue, I call Zahir and I do the same what he tells me to do. So I called Zahir directly for the AC problem and he got the information and told me that it will cost about 90 thousand rupees for cable change. But I didnt need to change the cable and the issue was sorted out. Itd have been cost around 90 thousand and extra for VAT and something but it only cost 5000 rupees to fix the issue. If Id have to change the AC wire then Id have been cost 90 thousand rupees. And if Id have gone to somewhere else then theyd have told me that the whole wiring would have to be changed. So I went to the Rourkela dealership with the thought that Id have to change the wire. But this dealership staffs told me that there was no problem and itd be solved. When I was talking to Zahir, he told me to go to the dealership and theyd check the issue and then solve it. And that time, Zahir didnt have the idea so he said that itd cost 18-20 thousand rupees because it cant be understood how damaged the wire was when we were talking over the phone.  So I went there with the preparation that Id change the wire. So I went to the dealership and showed them the problem. There was the service manager, I dont the name of that manager but the person was Bengali, I talked to the manager also. The manager told me that Id not have to change the wire and itd be repaired but if Id tell them to change the wire then itd take time because theyd order it and then change it. And also told me if Id want to change it later then I could change it but that time theyd do the repairing. There was no problem and they sorted it out.

3215,"Sometime ago my car had a brake down; my car was in my house. The wire of my car was burnt; or rat had cut it or what happened I dont know. At the time of taking the car, towing person had broken the front looking glass of my car. The staffs were come from Sambhalpur dealership. Two staffs came and took my car from my house. After that company has repaired my car and made it ready. After that I got my car back from the dealership, while returning home after travelling 10kms, I saw that glass of my car was broken. At that moment, I called the towing staff because my cars glass was broken, then they told me the cars glass was already broken. I told towing staff, if the cars glass was already broken then it was not mentioned in your documents. This is my car, I know about my car, how it can be break. It is kept in my house nothing is there in my house, so that the glass can break. Now you are telling me that the glass of my car was broken. This you had not told me before. I told the towing staff to come immediately at Sambhalpur and then they told me I am not in Sambhalpur, it will take 10days to come. I told the tow staff that did I buy my car from a fancy shop with 20 rupees? I paid 20lakh and purchase my car from Toyota showroom and you are doing job for RS10-1500. I told the tow staff do not mention the name of Toyota and disconnected the line, immediately, I complaint to Toyota. When I complaint Toyota and told the staffs of Toyota that I am leaving my car in the showroom. I dont want my car and if you will return me the car, then fit a new glass in my car, whatever you want to do you can do but I want my car. The Sambhalpur officer (in charge) Mr. Bapi, head of the showroom Mr. Satapathy (Manager) and entire staff of the showroom requested me and help a lot for this matter. I told them that, I would burn my car here then I will get a new car on insurance, now I dont want this damaged car. I am not that kind of person, who changes the small thing and make it big. I have kept a car of 25lakh in my house and I am a single person who uses the car. I told both the officers Mr. Bapi and Mr. Satapathy, with whom I had conflict regarding this matter. I told both of them, any how you have to fit the new glass in my car and I am paying for it. If you will do this work tomorrow, then I will not take my car. the officers told me that your car is under insurance or you will pay money, whatever it may be, you have to keep your car in the showroom till tonight, because it will take 12 hours to dry the gum of the glass. After that the both the officers co-operate a lot. I fought with them too much; even then they kept my car in their showroom. I paid 2000 rupees as insurance and did the insurance claim and then they fitted the new glass in my car. After that the officers had a discussion with the towing staff over phone and had quarrel among them. Till now, I don't know what has happened among them and I didn't call them but staffs of Toyota helped me, so much for this I felt good. First time, I visited the dealership of Sambhalpur and I will never say anything bad to the staffs of Sambhalpur only I will appreciate the staffs. At that time, I told many things and used abuse languages for the staffs but in return, they had not said anything to me. When staffs of the showroom received my car towing staff didnt told them that the glass was broken, he told me that the glass of my car was broken and didnt inform the company. Toyota also has a mistake, while receiving the car they also need to check it. I didnt know actually, what has happened.  After that the staff of the dealership supported me a lot for this I felt very good. My car was kept in my house and brake down occurred in my car and I complaint for it but it was not happened in last servicing. The name of the persons with whom I had heart touching is Mr. Bapi in charge of the showroom and its senior one is Mr. Satapathi he is the head of the showroom (Manager) both the staffs sort out all my problems. At that evening, what I will do with my car that even I also didn't know. For this big problem, Toyotas image was going to get worst and I told both the staffs that I was about to lodge consumer report. I had not purchased the car from fancy shop by paying RS 20; I paid 20lakh and purchased my car from the showroom. I told them officers many things then also they totally supported me. Even I cant image that Toyota Company has appointed such a good staff. The staffs of this dealership knows how to handle any kind of customers and whatever may the reaction of the customers, they have patience and they know the way, how they can sort out the problem of the customers. The staffs of this showroom also had to face problem because of the tow staff. The way both the staffs helped me on that day, I would not able to express my feelings, for this I felt too good.","[(roadside assistance, 99.3), (issue resolution, 0.27), (pick up / drop, 0.2), (personal need, 0.12), (quick service, 0.04), (forgotten stuff, 0.03), (free service / discount, 0.01), (others, 0.0), (care from staff, 0.0), (snacks, 0.0), (dealer event, 0.0), (gift / free stuff, 0.0), (detailed explanation, 0.0)]",roadside assistance,11,issue resolution,6

5231,"Every time when I went to the dealership of Topsel Siliguri for servicing, the staff gave me the service very well. Some days before when I went this dealership for last servicing with a little problem of my car and the problem was too little. The problem was that there was a sound occurring from the rear door of the right side of my car. As the dealership was too crowded so I could not expect that the dealership staffs would complete my work very quickly. This thing made me feel too good. Last time I visited this dealership without taking any appointment for periodic service. When I was going for some work, some sound was coming from my cars door. I told the staffs of the dealership about this problem and they done the work very soon. As many cars were crowded in this dealership, since there was little work to do so I do not have to sit for long and the staffs of the dealership did not make me stand in line; they did the work quickly, within a little bit time this I liked it very much. I went to the dealership without any booking and without informing them. Actually my house is 60km away from Siliguri city. When I was going to the city, I saw that a noise is coming from my cars door. With that problem I went to the dealership, without any booking, without informing them anything. Still the staffs carefully listened to my complaint and do the work immediately. The work was been done in a while. But despite there was crowd in the dealership the staffs did the work, this I liked it very much. Only 44 rupees was billed for my cars work, this touched my heart that for repairing an ordinary mobile phone, at first they charge RS 100. To visit the dealership with a car like Toyota, I feel proud for Toyota car and for that Toyota car they had provided that much time and they charged just Rs 44 for this I am totally surprised and this touched my heart. The staff who helped me and with whom I had heart touching experience, his name is MR. Krishna Babu and he sits in the desk and  I went to MR. Krishna Babu  and told him about my problem then he checked my cars problem and called the technician and sort out my cars problem. After entering from the entrance gate of the dealership there is a desk at the left side where 2 to 3 staffs of the dealership sits in front of the computer Mr. Krishna Babu also sits there and he makes bill and do the work of our car. I could not able to understand his designation properly.MrKrishna Babu do this works. I keep the bill in front of my car.

2899,"Maximum staffs of Raurkela are in field and they are too good. They are always friendly while talking. Among the staffs 2-3 staffs are known by me and always deal respectfully with me and other customers. There is no problem in the car. Normally all the works for which we visit the dealership are good, we get A1 treatment and the dealing of the dealership staffs is good. Among the field staff one of the staff is always in contact with me because first time, I purchased the car. He always give me guideline for cars washing, manual maintenance and personal maintenance. Over phone he does the counseling and guide me if you will keep your car in this way then it would be good like, if you will wash the cars engine directly in water then it would be good, you are washing the cars body but you should safe the engine a little bit, whenever we go to outsides petrol pump the staffs of the petrol pump give us some offer, the staff of the dealership refuses the things. This car is structured, so solid that its a number 1 car, it is good. We do not have to purchase parts from outside. Toyota Company has its own dealership, so if you will purchase parts from outside then it will be risky for us, any kind of damages can happen, Sometimes he provides me these kind of guidelines, I also give him feed back. Once I was not in my home then the dealership staff had delivered my car in my house. I had some work, I have not remembered the incident but the staff delivered my car in my home. I didnt have much time or I was not present in the dealership. This incident happens almost in the last year. I am not saying this incident as my heart touching incident because that staff is different from the other staffs of the dealership. Other staffs are also good but among them he was little bit unique. The staff belongs from my state. He is from Jharkhand.  Maybe there will be a bit of feelings in him, that we both belongs from the same state and  family feelings always communicates, that is why he is treating like this with me. If I will give credit to that staff then anyone can say that I am doing partiality, according to me I should not say this but his behavior is too good and his name is Mr. Aman. I dont know his full name but he is a young and energetic staff. In his batch many staffs are there their behavior is also like Mr. Aman. My connection is with Mr. Aman then it is not necessary to connected with other staffs because I am getting enough service from a staff. I dont know Mr. Amans designation; always he does field work, test drive of car and attend camps. On behalf of dealership, Mr. Amans other co-workers and colleague do the work of advertising sales camp or handles the marketing work. I meet with Mr. Aman in dealerships field so; I am in a good relation with Mr. Aman. Employees have quality and I do not see it according to marketing, they are satisfying me by providing such behavior and service. I will not say only Aman's name, I will say the name of overall Toyota. The dealership staffs give us credit, by saying that sir and Madam your behavior is too good. There is a win-win situation for both. Now, Positively Deal is done on both sides. I was not in my home and in dealership even after servicing, during servicing of my car I was completely absence but my work was done perfectly. You can say this as a heart touching because dealing is done by the company, company has its own business norms then it is different field. Once I faced problem but the dealership staffs performed more than that. At that time I had purchased the new vehicle, by the way I knew driving but I was not too much satisfied with my driving, so I used to do the driving less. I have very old driving experience, now its been approx 25 to 30 years I have been driving, but we feel some hesitation to handle the vehicle of new technology and in this case the dealership staffs help us and they respond so that they can provide us the service from the company so I feel good for this. The dealership staff named Aman, he has made such a good relation with us that we can give our house key to him if someone is present or not in our house, we can give him the key of our car which cost around 7.5-8 lakh, so we have a faith in him that we can easily give him our expensive things.","[(personal need, 81.7), (care from staff, 5.84), (issue resolution, 2.84), (pick up / drop, 1.78), (snacks, 1.49), (roadside assistance, 1.48), (others, 1.44), (gift / free stuff, 0.96), (detailed explanation, 0.81), (free service / discount, 0.59), (dealer event, 0.47), (quick service, 0.45), (forgotten stuff, 0.16)]",personal need,8,personal need,8
